### Project management

#### Checklist for NEW ideas :baby:
Hey, you're official! You're now part of the growing civic tech community in Buffalo. Here's a few things to get started (a couple you've probably already done).

- [x] Create this idea issue
- [x] Flesh out the who, where, and what questions above
- [ ] Start the conversation about this idea on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/codeforbuffalo/shared_invite/enQtMzk5NzA5MjA4NTQ0LWNlY2UyOWJlZWUxMjQ0NTE1M2RlOWNjNDcyNzkwZmYxNDY4MDE5ZGNhZjNhOWY4MWU2OWRhNGMzNzUwMmEzMTk)

#### Checklist for ACTIVE projects :fire:
Let's get this project started! When this idea starts taking off, the Projects Core Team will start helping this project's lead(s) out with project management and connecting you to resources you may need. To get there, please complete and check off the following:

- [x] Post an update at least once a month to this issue. Use [BASEDEF](https://github.com/open-austin/cheatsheet-basedef) for ideas, but it's ok even if your update is just "nothing new happened this month" or "we saw a small increase in traffic to our app this month". If there's no activity for two months, that's no problem, life happens. We'll just label this as `backlog` so others know you'll get back to it when you have the time. If nobody hears from you at all in more than two months, we may mark it as `abandoned` so that others can pick up this idea and run with it.
- [ ] Take 30 minutes to complete [Open Leadership 101](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) 
- [ ] Create a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/new). Ask for help setting up permissions if you want your repository to be within the [Code for Buffalo Github organization](https://github.com/CodeForBuffalo/).
- [ ] Create a [README file](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) in your project repository. This file should help newcomers understand what your project is, why it's important, and kinds of help you're looking for.
- [ ] [Create issues](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/project-set-up-for-collaboration-with-github/#assignment--add-your-first-issue) to describe each task that you plan to do or need help with and how a contributor can get started on that task. You might start and stop a lot, so consider issues as your to-do list.
- [ ] Create a [team](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-team/) for your core contributors
  - This will make it easier for you to manage your github repo access. People on a team have the same level of access. Admin access will allow your trusted contributors to make changes as needed. 
  - You can remove and add people to your team as needed. 
 <!-- ADD BUFFALO TEAMS View some of our teams: [https://github.com/orgs/open-austin/teams](https://github.com/orgs/open-austin/teams) -->
  - Note: You can also allow collaborators outside of your team and give them more limited access.
- [ ]   Create a new project channel in Slack so you can "@" your core contributors all at once.
- [ ]   Create a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), or other cloud storage to share larger files. Github and Data.World are good for code and data, respectively, especially when you need version control. But they're not good for very large files, documentation, articles, etc. A cloud storage option will allow you to easily share, create, and collaborate on documents with your team and help organize ideas and thoughts.
  - Doing this early on can help your team stay organized and to onboard new contributors who wouldn't have access to files you all have shared over email.

#### Checklist for FEATURED Projects :tada:
To have your project FEATURED on the [Code for Buffalo website](https://codeforbuffalo.org/), complete the following documentation. In past projects, well-documented featured projects have more contributions than other projects.

- [ ] In your README, link to the [Code for Buffalo Code of Conduct](https://codeforbuffalo.org/code-of-conduct) or write your own code of conduct.
- [ ] [Create file: LICENSE](http://choosealicense.com/) to give your project an open license, allowing for sharing and remixing.
- [ ] [Create file: CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozsprint-repo-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) so others know [how they can contribute](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).
- [ ] Create an easily shareable project management artifact, like a [Civic Tech Canvas](https://cityofaustin.github.io/civic-tech-canvas/) or [Open Canvas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/)
- [ ] [Create an issue](https://github.com/CodeForBuffalo/project-ideas/issues/new) on the CodeForBuffalo.github.io repo with the title `Add [my project] to projects page`. A Code for Buffalo leader will review this issue and post your project :balloon:
- [ ] [Tell the City of Buffalo](https://data.buffalony.gov/stories/s/8ibu-5j7v/). If your idea is in a shareable format and can benefit people around the city, go to that site and follow the instructions on the bottom of the page to showcase your work there.

If you get stuck at any point, feel free to reach out to the leadership team on Slack by adding @leadership to your message. We're here to help you make real changes to our city.
