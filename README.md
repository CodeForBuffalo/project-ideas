### About the Open Austin Hack Team

Open Austin uses civic tech to improve quality of life. We want to help citizen, government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems. 

Open Austin is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) organization. We make software freely and openly available. GitHub is our platform of choice. Think of it as collaboration + technology. There are some really handy tools here, including a feature called [*Issues*](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues).

Got an idea? Even a tiny one? SHARE IT!

Thanks for co-creating with us!

## How To Propose or Discuss Project Ideas

[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) work just like any other commenting system on the Internet. First, you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/join). Then you have two options: (1) comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue"), or (2) create a new idea.

If you see an idea that you're interested in, click on it, read the discussion, and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you don't see the idea you have in mind, [add a new one](https://github.com/code4sac/projects/issues/new). You'll need a title and description and we encourage you to use the Template below. Then, someone from the Open Austin Core Team will respond, likely with some questions or feedback. 

GitHub is the platform we're using to collect ideas, vet ideas, and convert those ideas into active projects. Once a project becomes active, a new *repository* on GitHub will be created where all subsequent conversations about that project will live. We'll continue to use the Issues feature to flag obstacles, opportunities, and answer questions about that specific project.

*Here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4) on using Github Issues for discussion.*

### Template for New Project Ideas

*(Copy and paste the below into a new issue.)*

```
**Concise description. What problem are you trying to solve?**: 

**Link (more details/brain dump/alpha)**

**Who will use/benefit from this project?**

**Project Needs (dev/design/resources)**

**Status (experiment, alpha, beta, official)**

```

### Project Stages

Code for America has released some official project stages:

- Experiment - Explore the problem/idea. Have lots of these.
- Alpha - Solve one person's problem
- Beta - More users
- Official - Impact

More details about these stages are available here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z33SXl78c3UlO2VOA9SjXTVMHdY9ogjMJBLB6SMN7j0/edit#slide=id.gbb3e3eab5_0_141. This includes outlining what a brigade is expected to do at each stage and what Code for America can do
